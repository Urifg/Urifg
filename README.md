## 👋 Hi, I’m Uriel Fernández

Software Engineer based in 🇪🇸 Spain

I’m not a great programmer — yet — but I’m fully committed to becoming one, and I love the process.
I’d rather struggle while improving than never try at all.

I focus on concepts, architectures, design patterns, and problem-solving over specific technologies, though I do have my preferred tools to turn ideas into real solutions.

Always learning. Always building.
